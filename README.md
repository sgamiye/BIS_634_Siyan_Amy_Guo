Exercise 1:
Function and associated test presented in the Exercise1.ipynb file

Exercise 2:
After examining the data:It has columns for name, age, weight, and eyecolor. And it has 152361 rows (people).
For age:
Statistics for age: the mean: 39.510527927396524; standard_deviation: 24.152760068601445; minimum: 0.0007476719217636152; maximum: 99.99154733076972
Role of the number of bins:the number of bins (associated with binwidth) determine the presentation of the histogram's pattern. If the number is too great, there will be too much details shown on the histogram, so that it is very difficult to recognize the actual pattern of the whole dataset, and it may include noises that divert the pattern to be distracted. If the number of bins gets too low, it tends to oversmooth essential details such as peak counts at one datapoint. Therefore, it is very important to use an appropriate bin number to graph histogram so that the pattern and details of the data can be visualized as being closer to the true data pattern. 
Comment on any outliers or patterns: People at ages from 0 to approximately 70 have similar counts, while those at age 70-100 have similar counts, this shows a segmented pattern for people at ages below 70 and above 70.
For weight:
statistics for weight: mean: 60.88413415993031;standard_deviation: 18.41182426566149; minimum: 3.3820836824389326; maximum: 100.43579300336947
Comment on any outliers or patterns: According to the distribution shown on histogram, those with weight lower than 50 has a rather leveled and low counts, while for those with weight greater than 50 has a distribution similar to standard distribution,except for the outlier when weight equals to 68.0 (rounded) with count of 27842.
For scatter plot of weights vs. ages:
General relationship between the two variables: their relationship is generally following a positive trend. For weight lower than 40, the relationship between two variables are strongly positive;however, after weight=40, the relationship follows a weakly positive trend, with points strongly scattered.
The outlier's name is Anthony Freeman.
Process: Visualizing the scatter plot that demonstrates the relationship of weight and age allows the selection of the outlier-->According to it's rough ranges of the coordinations for the outlier shown on the plot, as shown in Exercise2.ipynb,the person was identified.

Exercise 3:
The date of downloading the data: 00:38,Sep19th, 2022
Data Source: The New York Times
limitations of newcases_vs_date:if the function takes on a list of states in which the number exceed the legen limit, there maybe same colors representing different states in the legend.

Exercise 4:
Explain briefly in terms of biology/medicine what the above search has found: There are diseases that are associated with both the nervous system and the immune system, as the list listed above. For example, for Multiple Sclerosis, the autoimmune function fails and starts to attack myelin sheath which is critical for effective signal propagations from action potentials and provide great insulations to the axon, and therefore, in this case, both immune system and nervous system are involved, which is very reasonable for there two be treennumbers associated with both.
